## Introduction
You're a Network Engineer who has spent decades configuring, monitoring and troubleshooting 
network devices through the CLI. It's familiar, comfortable and at times it feels like you could 
do it in your sleep.  So what's all this talk about network programmabilty? The CLI works just fine for you
so why should you care? 

The following scripts are just a few that were used as part of a presentation titled _"Network Programmability for the CLI Jockey"_. 

They are not meant to do anything more than illustrate concepts for the Network Engineer who is trying to figure out
what this new world of network programmabilty looks like and where they can start to make the transition. 

All scripts are intended for demonstration purposes only.
